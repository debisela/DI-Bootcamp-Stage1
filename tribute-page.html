              <h3>Who is Luna?</h3>
              <p>
                 Luna is our beloved but very annoying dog. She is a Canaan breed mix. We rescued her from a shelter when she was 3 month old and she is with us since then. She is driving us crazy... She likes to steal our food, sleep in our beds and chew our shoes. But she showed us what it means to take responsibility and prepared us for family life. She was a part of all major moments and we could not imagine our life without her.
